# rational_approx
This package is complementary to the manuscript: "Rational approximation and its application to improving deep learning classifiers," by V. Peiris, N. Sharon, N. Sukhorukova J. Ugon. See (arXiv link) https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11330.
The code aims to realize an efficient construction of rational minimax approximation via optimization.

Disclaimer: The package is yet to be fully finalized for publication (ETA: in a few weeks).
